1) The goal is to print numbers one by one from 1 to 100 in different forms.
2) We need to create a loop that provides us to count numbers.
3) There must be an interrogation for each step:
   a) Hello number, are you a multiply of 5 AND not a multiply of 7?
      -If yes, then I will give an order to print "Power". If not, you can pass on to the second question.
   b) Are you a multiply of 7 AND not a multiply of 5?
      -If yes, then I will give an order to print "Coders". If not, you can pass on to the third question.
   c) Are you a multiply of 5 and 7 at the same time?
      -If yes, then I will give an order to print "PowerCoders".
      -If not, then I will give an order to print the number as it is. Next, please!
